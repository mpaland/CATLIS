## Computer Aided Theatre LIghting System

This is (was) a program to control a theatre lighting system.  
This ancient original sources are just here out of emotional, nostalgic reasons.  

### Historical background
In the 80s I was working as a lighting technician in the Mittwoch:Theatre, Hannover.  Professional (computer) lighting systems were not affordable, we had to setup all lighting scenes manually.  
So the first ideas of an own computer controlled lighting system came up in 1989, way before DMX was invented.  
Dim packs were analogue controlled by voltage levels (0 to -10V) theses days.  
After some promising electrical proof of concept tests this software was written in Turbo Pascal.  
The very first CATLIS version controlled a self made box which was connected to the PC parallel port and
received commands like an old Centronics printer. This box generated 0 to -10V on 16 channels to control the
dim packs.  
Later on in 1993 newer dim packs with a DMX interface were bought togehter with a DMX controller, connected to the parallel port as well (no USB that time).
So CATLIS was slightly modified for driving the DMX controller.
